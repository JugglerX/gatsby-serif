## Our History



 Prior to forming the foundation, Dave and Wendy Morgan were very active in the establishing the Glen Ziegler Scholarship one-million-dollar fund which provides $10,000 each year for four years for the top graduate of the Future Farmers of America organization at Mt. Baker High School, Deming, WA. At present four Ziegler recipients are attending university.

 In addition, Dave and Wendy donated two mobile medical units to the Blackfoot Indian nation in 2020. These units were used extensively in providing vaccine administration during the recent two-year covid 19 pandemic.

 Dave and Wendy began applying for 501cC3 status late in 2020 and received approval in early 2021. See attached IRS documentation.
