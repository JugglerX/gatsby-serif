# Our Mission Statement

The Dave and Wendy Morgan Foundation's mission is to provide funds to charitable organizations that promote activities that help people help themselves. 

The foundation is a broad-based foundation that will chart its future charitable selections based upon its ever-changing history of actual gifting. Early Foundation contributions were focused on the Blackfoot Nation in Montana, water wells in Uganda (Water4Kids), and tuition assistance for wounded veterans (See4Vets).

Our foundation does not have a fixed selection criteria based upon state, region, or country. It is entirely possible that 100% of the donations in any one year could go to outside the United States while in other years virtually all may go to US based charities. 

Part of the selection process will include how the charity permits us to direct our funds as close to the specific recipient or end user as possible.  For example, when a charity needs food, we would prefer to fund the food supplier rather than the general fund of the charity.
